# Enumeration of permutation graphs

The programs are implementation of an algorithm which enumerates all permutation graphs up to isomorphism in [[1]](1). Our programs are written in C++. compiling the programs by `make` in the command line and, you get the execution file 'main.exe'. You run 'main.exe' with an integer as a command line argument, and then obtain a 'permX.dat' file. For example, if you type './main.exe 4' in the command line, you can obtain 'perm4.dat' file and a content of the file is as follows. 
```
4 3 2 1
4 3 1 2
4 1 3 2
1 4 3 2
4 1 2 3
1 4 2 3
2 4 1 3
2 1 4 3
1 2 4 3
1 2 3 4
3 4 1 2
```
Permutations represent permutation diagrams of permutation graphs. Each permutation is a canonical form of a permutation graph, that is, the permutations have one to one correspondence to the permutation graphs. You can see the part of the results in [[2]](2)

We use an implementation of modular decomposition which is developped by Fabien de Montgolfier. You can see the program [here](https://github.com/vbraun/graph-modular-decomposition).
